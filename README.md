# Password Generator Starter Code

This web application generates a random password based on the criteria selected using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Project Aims 
* When click to generate a new password, user is taken through a series of prompts indicating criteria they would like for their password. 
* For each criteria selected, there will be at least one of that character type included in the generated password. If the criteria is not selected, it will not be included in the password.
* Password characters must be between 8 and 128 characters. 
* Random password is generated. 

Some strategies practiced include creating functions, for loops, and if-else statements.
